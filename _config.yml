    description: "
    I'm Seungyong Lee. I joined the AppSuit team at Stealien, a cybersecurity company based in South Korea, on September 27, 2022, where I conducted Android security research.
    As of January 1, 2025, I became a member of the Red Team, working alongside talented hackers to embrace challenging missions, including APT simulations and 0-day/1-day vulnerability research and development.<br/><br/>

    This blog is a space where I share my hands-on experiences and explore the fascinating technologies I’ve encountered.
    Join me in navigating the ever-evolving world of cybersecurity and innovation.
